  <Description>
    MQTT for Unraid6 Docker Manager running on Port 1883 and 9883[br][br]
    MQTT is a machine-to-machine (M2M)/"Internet of Things" connectivity protocol. [br]
    It was designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe messaging transport. [br]
    It is useful for connections with remote locations where a small code footprint is required [br]
    and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. For example, it has been used in sensors [br]
    communicating to a broker via satellite link, over occasional dial-up connections with [br]
    healthcare providers, and in a range of home automation and small device scenarios. [br]
    It is also ideal for mobile applications because of its small size, low power usage, [br]
    minimised data packets, and efficient distribution of information to one or many receivers[br]
    [br][br][br]
    This version supports passwords - see passwords.README in the /config directory.[br]
    Also supported are websockets and certificates.[br]
    [br]
    An example config file is stored in the data directory. If you have used an older Docker your config may need changing.[br]
    [br]
    Note that you may have to use NEWPERMS to edit the config files.[br]
    The permissions for unraid have been removed to allow this to be a multihost docker.[br][br][br]
    The docker is built on a Alpine Linux base.[br]
